# Caught in 4K
Allows you to customize the resolution the video camera records in.

*Don't actually set it to 4K as that will extremely likely crash your game.*

Resolution can be configured in the config file. Big revelation, I know.

I recommend using [Flashcard](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/loaforc/Flashcard/) alongside this mod because the increased resolution probably won't be noticable without a higher bitrate. Also a great way to make your vido file sizes way too big.
